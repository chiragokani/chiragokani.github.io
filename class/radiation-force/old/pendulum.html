<p>Consider a pendulum of length \(l\), where the bob has mass \(m\) and is subject to the downward force \(mg\) due to gravity. Accordingly, the tension of the string on which the bob is suspended equals \(mg\). The string passes through (but is not attached to) a ring that constrains the length of the pendulum, and which itself is constrained to the vertical line defined by the equilibrium position of the bob:</p>

<p>Then, for small deflection angles \(\theta \ll 1\), \(\sin\theta \simeq \theta\), and Newton's second law reduces to a linear second-order ordinary differential equation in \(-\pi/2 \leq \theta\leq \pi/2\), which is the angle measured from the downward direction:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pend}
mg \theta \simeq  - ml \frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}\,.
\end{equation}
Denoting the maximum deflection angle \(\theta_0\), the general solution of Eq. \eqref{eq:pend} is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:sol}
\theta = \theta_0 \sin (\omega t - \phi)\,,\quad \theta_0 \ll 1
\end{align}
where \(\omega = \sqrt{g/l} = 2\pi f\), and thus the period is
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:tau}
\tau = 1/f = 2\pi \sqrt{{l}/{g}} \,.
\end{align}
An underlying assumption of Eqs. \eqref{eq:pend}, \eqref{eq:sol}, and \eqref{eq:pend:tau} is that any vertical motion of the ring is much slower than the motion of the bob, which is to say that \(l\) is nearly constant over a period of oscillation. <!--It will be seen that this assumption is consistent with the small-angle approximation \(\theta \ll 1\).--></p>


<p>Two approaches are taken toward calculating the radiation force exerted by the bob on the ring. The first approach invokes the virial theorem to express the radiation force in terms of the total energy \(E\). The second approach uses the principle of adiabatic invariance (along with the work-energy theorem) to arrive at the same result. Both calculations are summarized on p. 1026 of Ref. <a href="refs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="virial">By the virial theorem</h3>
<p>The first approach is based on Rayleigh's papers 
<blockquote>
Philos. Mag. <b>3</b>, 338-346 (1902) <br>
Philos. Mag. <b>10</b>, 364-374 (1905),
</blockquote>
in particular pp. 338-339 of the 1902 paper.
</p>

<p>The instantaneous upward force exerted on the ring is \(F = mg (1-\cos\theta) \simeq mg\theta^2/2\), the time average of which equals the <i>radiation force</i> 
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:F:av}
F = mg [1-\langle\cos\theta\rangle] \simeq mg\langle\theta^2\rangle/2\,.
\end{align}
Meanwhile, noting that the potential energy of the bob is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:U}
U = mgl (1-\cos\theta) \simeq mgl \theta^2/2
\end{align}
such that \(U = 0\) in the equilibrium position \(\theta =0\) allows Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:F:av} to be written as
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:Frad:1}
{F} = \langle U\rangle/l \,.
\end{align}
Noting that the total energy is
\begin{align}\label{eq:tot}
E = T + U
\end{align}
and that in a simple harmonic oscillator 
\begin{align}\label{eq:virial}
\langle U \rangle = \langle T\rangle = \langle E\rangle/2
\end{align}
(a consequece of the virial theorem; see Sec. 7.13 of Ref. <a href="refs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>), Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:Frad:1} can be written as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:Frad}
\boxed{{F} = \langle E\rangle/2l \,,}
\end{align}
where, in view of Eqs. \eqref{eq:sol}, \eqref{eq:pend:tau}, \eqref{eq:pend:U}, and \eqref{eq:virial},
\begin{align}\label{eq:E}
\langle E \rangle = mgl \langle\theta^2\rangle &= mgl\theta_0^2 \tfrac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau\sin^2 (\omega t - \phi) dt = mgl \theta_0^2/2\,.
\end{align}
As a sanity check, Eq. \eqref{eq:E} can be recovered from energy conservation. The total energy of the system is constant, which is to say that the time-averaged total energy \(\langle E \rangle\) equals the instantaneous energy \(E\). Since \(\langle E \rangle\) equals \(E\) at any time \(t\) of the pendulum's motion, we choose to calculate \(\langle E\rangle\) by considering a time at which \(E\) is easy to evaluate. As can be seen from Eq. \eqref{eq:sol}, times \(t\) that satisfy the equation \(\sin(\omega t - \phi) = \pm 1\) correspond to the bob attaining the maximum deflection angle \(\theta = \theta_0\), for which 
\begin{align}\label{eq:T:0}
T = \tfrac{1}{2} m l \dot{\theta}^2 =  ml \omega^2 \cos^2(\omega t - \phi) = 0\,.
\end{align}
Combining Eqs. \eqref{eq:pend:U}, \eqref{eq:tot}, and \eqref{eq:T:0} shows that \(E = U = mgl\theta_0^2/2\), recovering Eq. \eqref{eq:E}  
</p>

<p>Now combining Eqs. \eqref{eq:pend:Frad} and \eqref{eq:E} yields the radiation force in terms of the amplitude \(\theta_0\), which from Eq. \eqref{eq:sol} is a small parameter:
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:Frad:theta}
{F} = mg \theta_0^2/4 \,.
\end{align}
That Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:Frad:theta} is weaker than the force due to gravity on the bob by two orders in \(\theta_0\) is consistent with the assumption underlying Eq. \eqref{eq:sol}, namely that the length of the pendulum is nearly constant over a period of oscillation. Over the course of many oscillations, however, the total energy of the oscillations will be expended in the work done in moving the ring vertically. The differential amount of energy required in performing this differential amount of work is 
\begin{align}
dE = -\tfrac{1}{4}mg \theta_0^2 \, d\theta_0
\end{align}

<h3 id="adiabat">By adiabatic invariance</h3>
<p>
Equivalently, by the principle of adiabatic invariance, "under a very slow and continuous change of a constraint parameter, the product of the period \(\tau\) and the mean value of the kinetic energy \(\langle T\rangle \) remains a constant":
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:adiabat}
\delta(\tau T) = \tau dT + T d\tau = 0\,.
\end{align}
Dividing Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:adiabat} by \(\tau T\) yields
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:adiabat:dt}
\frac{dT}{T} + \frac{d\tau}{\tau} = 0\,.
\end{align}
The time-averaged work done by the bob on the string is \(dW = F\,dl\), which by the work-energy theorem is \(-dT = -dE\) {See Sec. 2.5 of Ref. <a href="refs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>}. Thus Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:adiabat:dt} becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:adiabat:dt:2}
-\frac{F\,dl}{\langle E\rangle} + \frac{d\tau}{\tau} = 0\,.
\end{align}
Combining Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:adiabat:dt:2} with Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:tau} yields
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:adiabat:dt:3}
-\frac{F\,dl}{\langle E\rangle} + \frac{d\tau}{2\pi \sqrt{l/g}} = 0\,.
\end{align}
Solving Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:adiabat:dt:3} for \(F\) gives
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:adiabat:dt:4}
F = \frac{d\tau}{dl} \frac{\langle E\rangle}{2\pi\sqrt{l/g}}\,.
\end{align}
Noting that 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\tau}{dl} = 2\pi \frac{d}{dl} \sqrt{l/g} =  \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}} \frac{\pi}{g}
\end{align*}
yields the force from Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:adiabat:dt:4} 
\begin{align}\label{eq:pend:adiabat:F}
{F = \frac{\langle E\rangle \pi/g}{2\pi l/g} = \langle E\rangle/2l\,,}
\end{align}
recovering Eq. \eqref{eq:pend:Frad}.
