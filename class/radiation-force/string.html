<p>The linear wave equation for a string is derived. Kinetic and potential energy densities are then obtained. Energy conservation yields a differential equation that relates the total energy of the vibrating string to the energy flux. A differential equation for momentum conservation at quadratic order is then derived in terms of a parameter called the "radiation stress." The radiation force equals the time average of the difference in radiation stress ahead and behind the scatterer. </p> 


<h3 id="wave">Wave equation</h3>
<p>Consider a string with uniform mass per unit length \(\rho_0\) and constant tension \(\mathcal{T}\). The tension can be assumed to be constant because <a href="refs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a></p>

<blockquote>
If the string is quite elastic, it has already been stretched quite a bit when it was put under tension \(T\); so the small increase in length involved in the displacement would not increase the tension by an appreciaciable amount. 
</blockquote>

<p>The wave equation for the transverse displacement \(y = y(x,t)\) is derived by appealing to Newton's second law. As shown in the figure below, the transverse force is \(\mathcal{T}\sin [\theta(x + \Delta x)] - \mathcal{T}\sin[\theta(x)]\), where \(\theta(x,t)\) is the deflection angle of the string, where \(\theta =0\) coincides with the \(x\) axis:
</p> 

<img src="fig/string.png" width="225px"><br>

<p>Assuming \(\theta \ll 1\) allows for the transverse force to be written as \(\mathcal{T}[\theta(x + \Delta x) -\theta(x)]\). By Newton's second law, this force equals the mass \(\rho \Delta x\) times the acceleration \(\ddot{y}\):
\[\rho_0\Delta x \ddot{y} = \mathcal{T}[\theta(x + \Delta x) -\theta(x)].\] 
Dividing this equation by \(\Delta x\) and taking the limit as \(\Delta x \to 0\) yields
\[\rho_0 \ddot{y} = \mathcal{T}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x},\]
Noting that \(\partial y /\partial x = \tan \theta \simeq \theta\) results in
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave}
\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2} - \frac{1}{c_0^2} \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2} = 0\,,
\end{align}
where the speed of the wave is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:c}
c_0 = \sqrt{\mathcal{T}/\rho_0}\,.
\end{equation}
</p>

<h3 id="densities">Energy densities</h3>

<p>
 For an arbitrary transverse motion of the string, the associated kinetic energy density is 
\begin{align}\label{eq:kinetic}
\boxed{{T} = \tfrac{1}{2}\rho_0 (\partial y/\partial t)^2 .}
\end{align}
To calculate the kinetic energy of the motion of a string of length \(\ell\), Eq. \eqref{eq:kinetic} is integrated, i.e., the kinetic energy is \(\tfrac{1}{2}\rho_0 \int_0^\ell (\partial y/\partial t)^2 dx\). 
</p>

<p>
Obtaining the potential energy density of the string requires more effort. Displacing the string by \(\delta y\) corresponds to a differential length change of 
\begin{align}\label{eq:ds}
\delta s = \frac{\partial s}{\partial x}dx = \frac{dx}{\cos\theta}\,,
\end{align}
as can be seen in the figure above. [Partial derivatives are used because \(s = s(x,t)\) and \(y = y(x,t)\).]  Since \(1/\cos\theta = \sqrt{1+ \tan^2\theta}\), and since \(\tan\theta = \partial y/\partial x\), Eq. \eqref{eq:ds} becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:ds:2}
\delta s = \sqrt{1 + (\partial y/\partial x)^2} \, dx \simeq  \big[1 + \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial y/\partial x)^2\big] dx\,,
\end{align}
where the approximation neglects terms cubic in \(\partial y/\partial x\). Deforming the string from having an original length of \(\ell\) to a new length \(\ell + \delta s\) amounts to a total length change of 
\begin{align}\label{eq:length}
\int_0^\ell \sqrt{1 + (\partial y/\partial x)^2} \, dx - \ell \simeq \int_0^\ell \big[1 + \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial y/\partial x)^2\big] dx - \ell = \tfrac{1}{2} \int_0^\ell (\partial y/\partial x)^2 dx\,.
\end{align}
The work done in deforming the string equals the force times the displacement. Since \(\mathcal{T}\) is a constant, the work done is simply \(\mathcal{T}\) times Eq. \eqref{eq:length}: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:W}
W = \tfrac{1}{2} \mathcal{T} \int_0^\ell (\partial y/\partial x)^2 dx\,.
\end{align}
The quantity 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential}
\boxed{{U} = \tfrac{1}{2} \mathcal{T} (\partial y/\partial x)^2}
\end{equation}
is identified to be the potential energy density of the string. {See p. 101 of Ref. <a href="refs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a> for a discussion on the limitations of this interpretation.} 
</p>


<h3 id="energy">Conservation of energy</h3>
<p>Since \(\mathcal{T}\) is a constant, Eq. \eqref{eq:wave} can be written as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave:1}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( -\mathcal{T} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right) + \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = 0\,.
\end{align}
Multiplying Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:1} by \(\partial y/\partial t\) yields
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave:2}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( -\mathcal{T} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right) + \frac{\rho_0}{2} \frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2  = 0\,,
\end{align}
where it has been noted in the second term of Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:2} that 
\[\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial\dot{y}^2}{\partial t}\,.\]
In view of Eq. \eqref{eq:kinetic}, the third term of Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:2} is the time rate of change of the kinetic energy \({T}\). Since 
\[\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right) - \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x\partial t} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\,,\]
Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:2} becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave:3}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( -\mathcal{T} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right) + \mathcal{T}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x \partial t}\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial {T}}{\partial t}  = 0\,,
\end{align}
At this juncture, it is noted from the figure above that the force exerted by an element of the string on the left on an element to its right is \(-\mathcal{T}\partial y/\partial x\). The associated power is the force times the velocity \(\partial y/\partial t\) of this motion. The quantity appearing in the spatial derivative in the first term of Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:3} is therefore the energy flux of the string,
\begin{align}\label{eq:poynting}
I \equiv -\mathcal{T} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\,,
\end{align}
which can be thought of as the "Poynting scalar" (analogous to the Poynting vector of acoustics and electrodynamics). Meanwhile, the second term of Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:3} is simplified by noting that 
\begin{align}\label{eq:potential:2}
\mathcal{T}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x \partial t}\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{\mathcal{T}}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)^2= \frac{\partial {U}}{\partial t}\,,
\end{align}
where the last equality holds by Eq. \eqref{eq:potential}. In view of Eqs. \eqref{eq:poynting} and \eqref{eq:potential:2}, Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:3} becomes the energy conservation equation,
\begin{align}\label{eq:energy}
\boxed{\frac{\partial I}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}({U} + {T}) = 0\,.}
\end{align}
By analogy to acoustics and electrodynamics, Eq. \eqref{eq:energy} might also be regarded as the Poynting theorem for waves on a string. Equation \eqref{eq:energy} recovers Eq. (4.1.11) of Ref. <a href="refs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a>, though the mathematical development leading to Eq. \eqref{eq:energy} makes it more rigorous than what is presented in  Ref. <a href="refs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="momentum">Conservation of momentum</h3>
<p>A momentum conservation equation at quadratic order can be obtained by multiplying Eq. \eqref{eq:wave} through by \(\partial y/\partial x\),
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave:4}
\frac{\mathcal{T}}{c_0^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right) = \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} + \mathcal{T} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\,,
\end{align}
where Eq. \eqref{eq:c} has been invoked, and where it has been noted that
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)
- \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t \partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\,.
\end{align*}
Multiplying Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:4} through by \(-1\) and rearranging terms yields
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave:5}
\frac{1}{c_0^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(-\mathcal{T} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right) = - \mathcal{T} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} -\rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\,,
\end{align}
The quantity in the time derivative on the left-hand side of Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:5} is identified from Eq. \eqref{eq:poynting} to be the Poynting scalar \(I\). Dividing \(I\) by \(c_0^2\) yields a <i>momentum density</i>, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:g}
g \equiv I/c_0^2\,.
\end{align}
<p>Attention is now turned to the right-hand side of Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:5}. Since
\begin{align*}
 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^2,\qquad 
 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t\partial x} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)^2,
\end{align*}
Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:5} becomes 
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave:6}
\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = -  \frac{\mathcal{T}}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^2 - \frac{\rho_0}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)^2.
\end{align}
By Eqs. \eqref{eq:kinetic} and \eqref{eq:potential}, Eq. \eqref{eq:wave:6} becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:wave:7}
\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (-{T} - {U})\,.
\end{align}
The quantity \(-{T} - {U}\) can be written as \(L - 2{T} = L - \rho_0(\partial y/\partial t)^2\), where \(L\) is the Lagrangian density \(L = {T} - {U}\). Equation \eqref{eq:wave:7} then becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:momentum}
\boxed{\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial x}\,,}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq:stress}
S \equiv L - \rho_0 ({\partial y}/{\partial t})^2.
\end{align}
is the <i>radiation stress</i>. The integral form of Eq. \eqref{eq:momentum} is
\begin{align}\label{eq:momentum:int}
S(b)-S(a) - \frac{d }{dt}\int_a^b g\, dx =0 \,,
\end{align}
where the first two terms follow from the fundamental theorem of calculus.
</p>

<h3 id="force">Radiation force</h3>

<p>Equation \eqref{eq:momentum:int} was derived by integrating over free space, which implies that there is no change of mechanical momentum from points \(a\) to \(b\) per unit time. If there <i>is</i> an object between points \(a\) and \(b\), then the right-hand side of Eq. \eqref{eq:momentum} equals \(d{p}_\mathrm{mech}/dt\), which according to Newton's second law is the force \(F\) on the object. In particular, if attention is confined to time-harmonic solutions \(y\), time-averaging Eq. \eqref{eq:momentum:int} results in \(\frac{d }{dt}\int_a^b g\, dx\) vanishing by virtue of Item 2 of the <a href="ids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">useful identities</a>. The radiation force is therefore 
\begin{align}\label{eq:F}
\boxed{F = \langle S(b)\rangle - \langle S(a) \rangle\,.}
\end{align}
</p>

<p>The evaluation of Eq. \eqref{eq:F} is further specified by noting that in scattering problems, the total field is given by the sum of the incident and scattered fields, i.e., \(y = y_i + y_s\), where the subscripts "\(i\)" and "\(s\)" denote the incident and scattered fields, respectively. Thus
\begin{align}\label{eq:total:x}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}&= \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial y_s}{\partial x}\,,\\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}&= \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial y_s}{\partial t}\,.\label{eq:total:t}
\end{align}
In view of Eqs. \eqref{eq:total:x} and \eqref{eq:total:t}, the radiation stress tensor reads 
\begin{align}
S = L_i + L_s + L_{is} - \rho_0 (\partial y_i/\partial t)^2 - \rho_0 (\partial y_s/\partial t)^2 -2\rho_0(\partial y_i/\partial t)(\partial y_s/\partial t)\,,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
L_i &= \tfrac{1}{2}\rho_0 (\partial y_i/\partial t)^2 - \tfrac{1}{2}\mathcal{T} (\partial y_i/\partial x)^2\\
L_s &= \tfrac{1}{2}\rho_0 (\partial y_s/\partial t)^2 - \tfrac{1}{2}\mathcal{T} (\partial y_s/\partial x)^2\\
L_{is} &= \rho_0 (\partial y_i/\partial t)(\partial y_s/\partial t) - \mathcal{T} (\partial y_i/\partial x) (\partial y_s/\partial x)\,.
\end{align}
</p>

<p>If \(y = y_i + y_s\) can be calculated, and if its derivatives with respect to \(x\) and \(t\) can be taken, the radiation force can be calculated by Eq. \eqref{eq:F}. </p>

<p>Two important cases of Eq. \eqref{eq:F} are incident (1) traveling waves and (2) standing waves. I presented a few examples of for radiation force due to traveling waves on a point mass at the <a href="https://youtu.be/xQeYPCSkRf4?si=tgXvUarPwmIJImqQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas Acoustics seminar</a>. During the Q&amp;A, I demonstrated radiation forces exerted by standing waves on a string. Results for radiation forces exerted by progressive waves on extended scatterers will be presented at the 189th ASA meeting in Honolulu (December 2025).</p>
