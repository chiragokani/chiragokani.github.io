<h1>Simplicity</h1>

<p>by William Zinsser</p>

<p>Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society
strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous
frills and meaningless jargon.</p>

<p>Who can understand the viscous language of everyday American
commerce and enterprise: the business letter, the interoffice
memo, the corporation report, the notice from the bank
explaining its latest &quot;simplified&quot; statement? What
member of an insurance or medical plan can decipher the
brochure that tells him what his costs and benefits are? What
father or mother can put together a child's toy&mdash;on Christmas
Eve or any other eve&mdash;from the instructions on the box? Our
national tendency is to inflate and thereby sound important. The
airline pilot who wakes us to announce that he is presently
anticipating experiencing considerable weather wouldn't dream of
saying that there's a storm ahead and it may get bumpy. The
sentence is too simple&mdash;there must be something wrong with it.</p>

<p>But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to
its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every
long word that could be a short word, every adverb which carries
the same meaning that is already in the verb, every passive
construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing
what&mdash;these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the
strength of a sentence. And they usually occur, ironically, in
proportion to education and rank.</p>

<p>During the late 1960s the president of a major university
wrote a letter to mollify the alumni after a spell of campus
unrest. &quot;You are probably aware,&quot; he began, &quot;that
we have been experiencing very considerable potentially explosive
expressions of dissatisfaction on issues only partially
related.&quot; He meant that the students had been hassling them
about different things. I was far more upset by the president's
English than by the students' potentially explosive expressions
of dissatisfaction. I would have preferred the presidential
approach oaken by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he tried to convert
into English his own government's memos, such as this blackout
order of 1942: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Such preparations shall be made as will completely
    obscure all Federal buildings and non-Federal buildings
    occupied by the Federal government during an air raid for any
    period of time from visibility by reason of internal or
    external illumination.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Tell them,&quot; Roosevelt said, &quot;that in
    buildings where they have to keep the work going to put
    something across the windows.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simplify, simplify. Thoreau said it, as we are so often
reminded, and no American writer more consistently practiced what
he preached. Open <i>Walden</i> to any page and you will find a man
saying in a plain and orderly way what is on his mind:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I love to be alone. I never found the companion that
    was so companionable as solitude. We are for the most part
    more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in
    our chambers. A man thinking or working always alone, let him
    be where he will. Solitude is not measured by the miles 
    that intervene between a man and his fellows. The really
    diligent student in the crowded hives of Cambridge College
    is as solitary as a dervish in the desert.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can the rest of us achieve such enviable freedom from
clutter? The answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear
thinking becomes clear writing: one can't exist without the
other. It is impossible for a muddy thinker to write good
English. He may get away with it for a paragraph or two, but soon
the reader will be lost, and there is no sin so grave, for he
will not easily be lured back.</p>

<p>Who is this elusive creature the reader? He is a person with
an attention span of about twenty seconds. He is assailed on
every side by forces competing for his time: by newspapers and
magazines, by television and radio and stereo, by his wife and
children and pets, by his house and his yard and all the gadgets
that he has bought to keep them spruce, and by that most potent
of competitors, sleep. The man snoozing in his chair with an
unfinished magazine open on his lap is a man who was being given
too much unnecessary trouble by the writer.</p>

<p>It won't do to say that the snoozing reader is too dumb or too
lazy to keep pace with the train of thought. My sympathies are
with him. If the reader is lost, it is generally because the
writer has not been careful enough to keep him on the path.</p>

<p>This carelessness can take any number of forms. Perhaps a
sentence is so excessively cluttered that the reader, hacking his
way through the verbiage, simply doesn't know what it means.
Perhaps a sentence has been so shoddily constructed that the
reader could read it in any of several ways. Perhaps the writer
has switched pronouns in mid-sentence, or has switched tenses, so
the reader loses track of who is talking or when the action took
place. Perhaps Sentence B is not a logical sequel to Sentence
A&mdash;the writer, in whose head the connection is clear, has not
bothered to provide the missing link. Perhaps the writer has used
an important word incorrectly by not taking the trouble to look
it up. He may think that &quot;sanguine&quot; and
&quot;sanguinary&quot; mean the same thing, but the difference is
a bloody big one. The reader can only infer (speaking of big
differences) what the writer is trying to imply.</p>

<p>Faced with these obstacles, the reader is at first a
remarkably tenacious bird. He blames himself&mdash;he obviously missed
something, and he goes back over the mystifying sentence, or over
the whole paragraph, piecing it out like an ancient rule, making
guesses and moving on. But he won't do this for long. The writer
is making him work too hard, and the reader will look for one who
is better at his craft.</p>

<p>The writer must therefore constantly ask himself: What am I
trying to say? Surprisingly often, he doesn't know. Then he must
look at what he has written and ask: Have I said it? Is it clear
to someone encountering the subject for the first time? If it's
not, it is because some fuzz has worked its way into the
machinery. The clear writer is a person clear-headed enough to
see this stuff for what it is: fuzz. </p>

<p>I don't mean that some people are born clear-headed and are
therefore natural writers, whereas others are naturally fuzzy and
will never write well. Thinking clearly is a conscious act that
the writer must force upon himself, just as if he were embarking
on any other project that requires logic: adding up a laundry
list or doing an algebra problem. Good writing doesn't come
naturally, though most people obviously think it does. The
professional writer is forever being bearded by strangers who say
that they'd like to &quot;try a little writing sometime&quot;
when they retire from their real profession. Good writing takes
self-discipline and, very often, self-knowledge.</p>

<p>Many writers, for instance, can't stand to throw anything
away. Their sentences are littered with words that mean
essentially the same thing and with phrases which make a point
that is implicit in what they have already said. When students
give me these littered sentences I beg them to select from the
surfeit of words the few that most precisely fit what they want
to say. Choose one, I plead, from among the three almost
identical adjectives. Get rid of the unnecessary adverbs.
Eliminate &quot;in a funny sort of way&quot; and other such
qualifiers they do no useful work.</p>

<p>The students look stricken&mdash;I am taking all their wonderful
words away. I am only taking their superfluous words away,
leaving what is organic and strong</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; one of my worst offenders confessed, &quot;I
never can get rid of anything - you should see my room.&quot; (I
didn't take him up on the offer.) &quot;I have two lamps where I
only need one, but I can't decide which one I like better, so l
keep them both.&quot; He went on to enumerate his duplicated or
unnecessary objects, and over the weeks ahead I went on throwing
away his duplicated and unnecessary words. By the end of the
term&mdash;a term that he found acutely painful&mdash;his sentences were
clean.</p>

<p>&quot;I've had to change my whole approach to writing,&quot;
he told me. &quot;Now I have to think before I start every
sentence and I have to think about every word.&quot; The very
idea amazed him. Whether his room also looked better I never
found out.</p>

<p>Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very
few sentences come out right the first time. Or the third. Keep
thinking and rewriting until you say what you want to say.</p>
