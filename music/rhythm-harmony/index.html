<p>Rhythm, harmony, and melody are regarded as the "three foundational pillars of understanding" music, as Jacob Collier explains [1]: 
<blockquote>
There's rhythm, which is inside your body... It's time, how we organize time, how we place things in time. And there's melody, which all of you know how to do because you can all sing, right?... And then there's harmony, and harmony is the chords that you choose with whatever note you are playing in the melody. Harmony [is] my favourite part of music, because it's where all the colours are... You get to paint a picture. It's one of the most magical things about music.
</blockquote>

Of the three pillars, rhythm and harmony are more closely related, and melody functions as a "mysterious" connective tissue, as Pat Metheny describes [2]:

<blockquote>
<p>Melody, of the three branches of musical government, is the one you can't go to college for four years on. You can definitely go to college for four years on harmony, and you can definitely go to college for four years on rhythm. Melody, your theory teacher is going to talk for ten or fifteen minutes about lyrical "this" and intervalic leaps "that"&mdash;that does not begin to...explain why <i>this</i> works as a melody in a really great way, and this other very melodious-type idea does not... <!--I think sometimes people use the word "melody" almost as shorthand for "pretty" or "memorable" or "singable," or something like that. To me... you can take a bunch of trashcans and knock them down a flight of stairs, and you can transcribe that&mdash;that's a melody. It may not be a good melody, but there's melodic information to be had... It's the way it goes together, it's the way it flows, it's the way it connects. It's the way an ideas explores the territory that it suggests. To -->
</p>

<p>If you were talking to somebody, and you really want to share this cool thing that you've experienced, that you've found to be really true&mdash;it's <i>that</i>&mdash;<i>that's</i> melody to me. And how you do that can manifest in terms of intervals... but it can also manifest in harmony, and it can also manifest in rhythm, and that's really interesting too: they all work together, with melody being this "mystery figure" in it. </p>
</blockquote>

This informal talk is an attempt to organize my own thoughts on the role of <a href="#rhythm">rhythm</a> and <a href="#harmony">harmony</a> in music, what makes them musical, and how they are related. I provide examples that suggest that rhythm and harmony are different aspects of the same thing. I argue that while harmony is perceived by our ears, rhythm is a deeper concept, in that its periodicity is inferred by the intellect. At the same time, rhythm in music contains less information than harmony.</p>

<section id="rhythm">
<p><b>What is rhythm?</b> Rhythm arises due to the periodic overlapping of discrete events (or short pulses) where the periods of the events are integer multiples of each other.</p>

<p>In music, the ratio of the integers is usually not close to \(1\)&mdash;see <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/XLfMuRc9jq4?si=IMr6t8fXlzbDiyy6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for an example in which the ratio \(30/31 \simeq 0.967\) is demonstrated. In such extreme cases, the rhythm is perceived more as an interference phenomenon. In fact, the "important" rhythms that define musical beats and styles are mostly combinations of low numbers (like \(1, 2, 3,\) and \(4\)). For example, saxophonist Michael Brecker explains in <a href="https://youtu.be/GaEF9fLSptI?si=gaPGseL07Q_Dt_VT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> how he spent time early in his life trying to understand "how three goes against four," which he relates to "what makes music swing." See Ref. [4] for a metronome that allows for rhythms to be explored.</p>

<p><b>What makes rhythm musical?</b> In music, rhythm is more than a metronomic "tick." Musicians give life to rhythms by....
<ul>
<li>...accenting certain notes. For example, the 3:2 rhythm can be accented in different ways that implies different cultural connotations, as demonstrated by Wynton Marsalis's band <a href="https://youtu.be/bkyOFkBAMDg?si=VRuE1m_F3060v1b_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. For another example, <a href="https://youtu.be/gfovjTk0Qrw?si=5U4qowgGEwDsm0Q1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> is a video that John sent me that demonstrates another approach to the same rhythm&mdash;it is distinguishable from the traditional "shuffle" in how the notes are accented.</li>

<li>...combining of rhythm with melody and harmony. A classic example of this is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nQ2oiVqKHw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows XP startup sound</a>, which follows a 4:3 rhythm. </li>

<li>...microtiming or "lilting" the rhythms. Jacob Collier discusses the effect of shifting the timing of individual notes to create "gravity" or "momentum" in music <a href="https://youtu.be/mLJVvjqMjbo?si=ZyT1_j38CrqtFyhU&t=1323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Other examples of microtiming can be heard in samba, jazz, and hip-hop music (see: 
<a href="https://youtu.be/ijnujobdJ4c?si=yGPGLD38kJ0RJFhu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergio Mendes &ndash; "Magalenha"</a>, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfAGMs8hB0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Mintzer &ndash; "Brazilian Love Affair"</a>, 
<a href="https://youtu.be/AdZK0HeYkwM?si=U9ZzZngaQVkparw1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J Dilla &ndash; "So Far To Go"</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/_TRzd0xgSQk?si=7F4u-1ahmpOQwZhx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J Dilla &ndash; "Dreamy"</a>).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Rhythm is infrasonic.</b> The frequency of a rhythm is infrasonic. For example, a drumbeat played at \(120\) beats per minute corresponds to two beats per second. Eighth notes played at this tempo would correspond to four beats per second, which is to say that the frequency of the eighth notes is \(4\) Hertz (Hz). Though our ears cannot perceive frequencies below \(20\) Hz as tones, rhythm allows for us to "perceive" low frequency sound as a beat. We experience harmony directly using our ears, while we experience rhythm by inference. </p>

<p><b>Relationship between rhythm and harmony.</b> The connection between rhythm and harmony becomes even more clear when speeding up rhythms to frequencies in our hearing range. Jacob Collier demonstrates that rhythm is an infrasonic version of harmony in <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/9Jua53-w4U4?si=mcy4T_AJVsliySuM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>. The relationship between the rhythmic frequencies and the musical tones they correspond to when sped up is depicted below, where the numbers correspond to the multiples of the fundamental frequency (also known as the harmonic number).<br><br>

<img src="harmonic-series.svg" width="750"/><br>

The corresponding tones can be heard below. The rhythms can be generated using Ref. 4.</p>
<audio controls><source src="harmonic-series.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<p><b>Rhythmic inversion.</b> Rhythms can be "inverted," which leads to a tangible difference in how they are felt. For example, go to the <a href="https://poly.ozieblowski.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rhythm metronome</a> and set \(3:2\). Then invert the pattern by setting \(2:3\). How does this inversion change how you feel the beat? Does one rhythm feel stronger than the other? Does one rhythm sound brighter or darker than the other? Repeat this exercise for the \(4:3\) rhythm, whose inversion is \(3:4\).</p>
</section>

<section id="harmony">
<p><b>What is harmony?</b> Harmony arises from the overlapping of continuous waves in time. As is the case with rhythm, the frequencies of the waves are integer multiples of each other, and the ratio of the integers is usually not close to \(1\). See below for two examples of what two waves whose frequencies are nearly equal (\(440\) combined with \(442\) and \(444\) Hz, respectively) sound like.</p>
<audio controls><source src="beat-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
<audio controls><source src="beat-2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

<p><b>What makes harmony musical?</b> As is also the case with rhythm, musicians transform combination of notes into musical harmony by...
<ul>
<li>...using harmonic motion. See <a href="https://youtu.be/YMemmHgwBOA?si=PbLPDKVy0f9ybfYO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Herzlich tut mich verlangen" &ndash; J. S. Bach</a></li>

<li>...combining harmony with melody and rhythm.  See <a href="https://youtu.be/dYEHvdNkKes?si=Jr1vpBUlYytK2wwO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob Collier &ndash; "All I Need"</a>. </li>

<li>...detuning, e.g., temperament, vibrato, microtones, bending notes, etc., which is analogous to the concept of rhythmic microtiming. In this analogy, tempered music can roughly be thought of as "lilted." For example, the tempered fifth is \(2^{7/12} \simeq 1.4983\), while the just fifth is \(1.5\); if this relationship were converted to a rhythm, the tempered fifth would lag slightly behind the fundamental.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Harmonic inversion.</b> Finally, like rhythms, combinations of tones can be inverted by interchanging their order. The degree of any interval added to the degree of its inversion equals \(9\). For example, the inversion the combination of C and G (a fifth) is G and C (a fourth), and \(5+4\) is \(9\). The relationships between tones can be understood by placing all twelve notes in a circle, where clockwise motion corresponds to fifths and counter-clockwise motion corresponds to fourths:</p>
<img src="circle.svg" width="325"/><br>


<p>Clockwise combinations of notes results in bright sounds, and counterclockwise combinations of notes results in dark sounds. See <a href="https://youtu.be/mLJVvjqMjbo?si=rCABDai3D4MRKuPY&t=248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for Jacob Collier's demonstration of this concept.</p>
