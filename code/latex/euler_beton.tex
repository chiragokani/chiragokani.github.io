\section{Governing equations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a section. Keep in mind that all numbers (if meant to be  mathematical symbols) must appear in the math environment; for example consider 1 vs $1$. If one doesn't like the section/subsection/subsubsection formatting, one can delete these headers as well as the \texttt{\textbackslash tableofcontents}. Here is a centered aligned equation:
\begin{empheq}[box=\eq]{align}
\div \vec{u} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &= 0 \label{co}\\
\grad P + \frac{\partial }{\partial t}(\rho \vec{u}) &= 0 \label{mo}
\end{empheq}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Wave equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Linearizing equations (\ref{co}) and (\ref{mo}) and combining with an equation of state gives the wave equation of linear acoustics,
\begin{empheq}[box=\correct]{equation*}
\Laplacian P - \frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = \Order(\epsilon^2)
\end{empheq}
This can also be written as 
\begin{equation*}
\dAlambertian p = \Order(\epsilon^2)\,.
\end{equation*}
Here are some \TeX commands I always seem to forget: \texttt{\textbackslash gtrsim, \textbackslash lesssim, \textbackslash stackrel{?}{=}}.
